# 🧠 Myositis Detection Using Deep Learning & Grad-CAM

This project performs **multi-class classification of Myositis** (Dermatomyositis, Polymyositis, Inclusion Body Myositis) and **Normal** muscle ultrasound images using **CNN** and **VGG16 (Transfer Learning)**.  
It also includes **Grad-CAM visualizations** to provide medical interpretability by highlighting regions influencing the model’s prediction.
